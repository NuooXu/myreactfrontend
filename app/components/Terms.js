        Being kind (helpful, indulgent, considerate, or humane) to others boosts
        your serotonin, (the neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of
        satisfaction and well-being). Kindness leads to many good things like
        better relationships, improved self-esteem, compassion, happiness,
        future success, and good mental and physical health. And donâ€™t we all
        want that for our children, our families, our community, and the world?
